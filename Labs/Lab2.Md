### This Lab (on 2/5/2016) is on Open Source Licensing.
### A good reading material is http://opensource.org/licenses

1. Read the four criteria for Free Software http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

2.  Why it is important to choose a LICENSE - write two to five sentences

3.  Why one SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have a explicit license - write two to five sentences.

4. Read http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain - Failure to follow the Open System Model Section - why Gopher failed and HTTP survived - Do you agree with this claim? write two to five sentences.

45.  Android uses Apache license 2.0 and for kernel GPL v2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), Linux uses GPL v2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux ) license, 
Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license ( https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr ), SailfishOS is not open source ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS ).  Can you justify why
such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE  is enough). Instead of these four, you can look at any other software project and justify the license chosen for that project.

5.  Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github: http://choosealicense.com/

6.  Read these licenses  GPL, http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html LGPL http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html and Apache/BSD http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - Write  (work in groups of 4) - .

7.  Write five to ten sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and what technology stack you want/plan to use  and what license will you choose.
