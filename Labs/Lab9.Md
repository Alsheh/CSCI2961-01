## Lab 9 on Statistical Computing/Open Data/Data Science/Machine Learning

Data Science, Statistical Modeling and Machine learning are important current topics in Computer Science. There has been a lot of open source software and open data available.

http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/11/data-science-projects-learn/ gives recommendation of five projects to learn data
science.  In this lab you will be doing the first project - namely Titanic Data. This is available in kaggle site
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic (Kaggle holds competition on machine learning/data science - A couple of years ago,
one RPI (also worked in RCOS) student Diogo won the first place in the cause-effect pairs competition! http://rcos.rpi.edu/projects/protoml/
and https://www.kaggle.com/c/cause-effect-pairs/forums/t/5702/code-of-top-ranking-participants/30618 - So you too
can participate in the near feature and win)

Now back to the titanic

Titanic dataset is available in R https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/Titanic.html and csv format is
available in https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/Titanic.csv

For this lab, please do the following - Lab report should be in your github page

1) Read Chapter 9 of the book on Association Rule Mining  https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Zhao_R_and_data_mining.pdf 

2) Some background on Association rule mining  here

3) Implement (as in the chapter 9 of the book) association rules for Titanic Data set (experiment with different parameters 
in page 89 of the book for support and confidence

4) Try different visulaizations as done in chapter 9 of the text book.

5) (optional) Read the kaggle R tutotial on Machine Learning https://www.datacamp.com/courses/kaggle-tutorial-on-machine-learing-the-sinking-of-the-titanic  (Random forest is also discussed in chapter 4 of the Zhao's book)
(you can login with your facebook or google plus account or register)

6)  A paragraph description of the status of your project - What did you do last week on your project? You have
only 4 more weeks to finish your project.
